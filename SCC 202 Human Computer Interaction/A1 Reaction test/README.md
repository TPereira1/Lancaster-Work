This is the readme file for our reaction time experiment.
The aim of our experiment is to test whether a person tends to react to the colour of text first or to the text itself.

The experiment is broken up into to two test:
-First test is to test if a person reacts to colour of text first.
-Second test is to test a person tends to react to the text first rather then it's colour.

The experiment is carried out by displaying different colour words to the user and seeing how quickly they react when a certain colour/colour name is displayed to them. We also track the number of error they make durrring the test.
