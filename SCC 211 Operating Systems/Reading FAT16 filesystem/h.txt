This program uses fopen to open a file named "example.txt" in write mode ("w"). If the file is successfully opened, it uses fprintf to write a line of text to the file. Finally, it closes the file using fclose.

Compile and run this program, and it should create a text file named "example.txt" in the same directory as your program. Note that if the file already exists, running the program will overwrite its contents.

Remember to handle errors appropriately in a real-world scenario.
